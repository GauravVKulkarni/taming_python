Documentation of my learnings in python

Here's how I approached learning python (enough to get up and running)

1. Went to ChatGPT.
2. Asked it to break python syntax down into a list of topics. (like control flow, data types, etc)
3. then going through the topics one by one, asked it to break the topic into sub-topics. (like loops, exceptions from control-flow)
4. for each topic & sub-topic, asked it to provide -
    - general description
    - purpose of its existance
    - how/where it is used in real codebases
    - best practices and common pitfalls
    - 5 progressively tricky problems to solve using those concepts
5. Solved all 5 problems **without any help from any chatbot/auto-completion**. reading documentation and tutorial websites was the way.
6. Throughout this process, kept refining my own thinking, programming style.
7. Revisited the topics after a while with a new, fresh perspective.
