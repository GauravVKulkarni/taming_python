Documentation of my learnings in python

Here's how I approached learning python (enough to get up and running)

1. Went to ChatGPT (Yes. Hear me out.)
2. For various concepts/topics, asked it to provide -
    - general description
    - purpose of its existance
    - how/where it is used in real codebases
    - best practices and common pitfalls
    - 5 progressively tricky problems to solve using the concept
3. Solved all problems **without any help from any chatbot/auto-completion**. Reading documentation and tutorial websites was the way.
4. Kept picking up patterns throughout the process.
